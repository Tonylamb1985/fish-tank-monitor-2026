# 🐠 Aquarium Theme — Installation Guide

## Step 1 — Add Theme Support to configuration.yaml

Open your `config/configuration.yaml` and add:

```yaml
frontend:
  themes: !include_dir_merge_named themes
```

**If you already have a `frontend:` section**, just add the `themes:` line underneath it.

---

## Step 2 — Create the themes folder

Create a new folder in your Home Assistant config directory:

```
config/
└── themes/          ← create this folder
```

---

## Step 3 — Copy the theme file

Copy `aquarium.yaml` into the `themes/` folder:

```
config/
└── themes/
    └── aquarium.yaml
```

---

## Step 4 — Restart Home Assistant

Settings → System → Restart

---

## Step 5 — Apply the Theme

### Option A — Apply globally (all dashboards for you)
1. Click your profile icon (bottom left corner)
2. Scroll down to **Theme**
3. Select **Aquarium** from the dropdown
4. Refresh the page

### Option B — Apply to one dashboard only
1. Open the dashboard you want to theme
2. Click ⋮ (top right) → **Edit Dashboard**
3. Click ⋮ again → **Raw Configuration Editor**
4. At the very top, add:
   ```yaml
   theme: aquarium
   title: 🐟 Freshwater Tank
   ```
5. Save

### Option C — Apply backend-selected theme
1. Settings → System → General
2. Set **Default theme** to **Aquarium**
3. All users will now see the aquarium theme by default

## What You'll See

✅ **Deep ocean gradient background** — transitions from navy at top to teal at bottom  
✅ **Frosted glass cards** — all cards become translucent aqua panels with blur  
✅ **Cyan accents** — all interactive elements use ocean blue/cyan colors  
✅ **Aquarium glow** — soft cyan shadows around all cards  
✅ **Glass reflections** — subtle white highlights simulate glass surfaces  

---

## Customizing the Theme

Edit `config/themes/aquarium.yaml` to adjust:

- **Card transparency**: Change `card-background-color: "rgba(0,80,120,0.4)"` 
  - Higher last number = less transparent (e.g., `0.6` for more solid cards)
  
- **Accent color**: Change `primary-color: "#00b8d4"` to any hex color
  - Try `#00e676` for green, `#e040fb` for purple, `#ff6e40` for coral

- **Background gradient**: Edit the `lovelace-background` gradient stops
  - Change hex colors in the `linear-gradient(...)` definition

After editing, **Developer Tools → Services → frontend.reload_themes** to apply changes without restart.

---

## Reverting to Default Theme

1. Click your profile icon (bottom left)
2. Theme → **Backend-selected** (or **Default**)
3. Refresh the page

---

## Troubleshooting

**Theme doesn't appear in dropdown**
- Check `configuration.yaml` has `frontend: themes: !include_dir_merge_named themes`
- Verify file is at `config/themes/aquarium.yaml`
- Restart HA again

**Theme applied but cards still look default**
- Some custom cards ignore theme variables
- The fish tank dashboard already has inline styling that overrides the theme
- For full effect, use the theme globally + the aquarium-styled dashboard

**Background gradient not showing**
- The `lovelace-background` variable only works on some dashboard types
- For custom:grid-layout dashboards, background is set per-view in the YAML

**Cards look too transparent**
- Edit `aquarium.yaml`
- Change `card-background-color: "rgba(0,80,120,0.6)"` (0.6 = more solid)
- Reload themes

---

## Using with Other Dashboards

The Aquarium theme works beautifully with:
- Energy dashboard
- History graphs (cyan line colors)
- Logbook (frosted glass entries)
- Map (aqua markers)
- Media browser (translucent panels)

All HA dashboards will automatically use aquarium styling when theme is active.
